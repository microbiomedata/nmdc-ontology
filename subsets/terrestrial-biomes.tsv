<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001505>	"alpine tundra biome"	"A tundra biome which exists at high altitudes and where vegetation - dominated by a few species of dwarf shrubs, a few grasses, sedges, lichens, and mosses - is stunted due to low temperatures and high winds."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000219>	"anthropogenic terrestrial biome"	"An anthropogenic terrestrial biome is a terrestrial biome which has community structures determined by human activity."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000248>	"dense settlement biome"	"A dense settlement biome is an anthropogenic terrestrial biome which is primarily used for human habitation, recreation, and industry within built structures with little other land use."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000190>	"flooded savanna biome"	"A flooded savanna biome is a savanna biome which has very wet to saturated soil moisture content."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000181>	"mangrove biome"	"A mangrove biome is a terrestrial biome which includes, across its spatial extent, mangrove plants (Rhizophoraceae). Mangrove plants are able to withstand high levels of salinity as well as regions of anoxia and frequent tidal inundation. Mangrove biomes often occur near tropical and sub-tropical estuaries and depositional marine coastal environments where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high energy wave action."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000229>	"mediterranean savanna biome"	"A savanna biome which is subject to mediterranean climate patterns."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000217>	"mediterranean shrubland biome"	"A mediterranean shrubland biome is a subtropical shrubland biome which includes communities adapted to hot to warm, dry summers, mild to cold, rainy winters, and the influence of large, usually marine, bodies of water."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000208>	"mediterranean woodland biome"	"A subtropical woodland biome which includes communities adapted to hot to warm, dry summers, mild to cold, rainy winters, and the influence of large, usually marine, bodies of water."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000223>	"montane savanna biome"	"A montane savanna biome is a savanna biome which occurs in regions elevated above sea level and which has community structure determined by elevation-dependent environmental conditions."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000216>	"montane shrubland biome"	"A montane shrubland biome is a shrubland biome which occurs in regions elevated above sea level and which has community structure determined by elevation-dependent environmental conditions."

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000178>	"savanna biome"	"A savanna biome is a woodland biome which has seasonal water availability and includes, across its entire spatial extent, trees spaced sufficiently far apart to allow an unbroken layer of grass, sedge (Cyperaceae) or  rush (Juncaceae) communities to live."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000176>	"shrubland biome"	"A shrubland biome is a terrestrial biome which includes, across its entire spatial extent, dense groups of shrubs."

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000213>	"subtropical shrubland biome"	"A shrubland biome which is subject to subtropical climate patterns."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000222>	"subtropical woodland biome"	"A woodland biome which is subject to subtropical climate patterns."

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000446>	"terrestrial biome"	"A biome which is  primarily or completely situated on a landmass."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001369>	"tidal mangrove shrubland"	"A shrubland biome which is densely vegetated by dwarf or short mangroves (and associates) that are generally less than 6 meters in height, is tidally influenced,  is located in tropical or subtropical areas."
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000188>	"tropical savanna biome"
