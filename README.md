# NMDC Ontology

The NMDC Ontology (NMDCO) is used  by the [National Micrbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC)](https://microbiomedata.org) to annotate metagemoic metadata. The ontlogy products are built by merging a number of relevant ontologies (see the [import directory](src/ontology/imports/)) into a single ontology, and then converted into the appropriate product.

## Ontology Products

The main ontology products generated by this repo are:
- [nmdco.owl](nmdco.owl): An ontology build by merging the in the [import directory](src/ontology/imports/).
- [nmdco-relation-graph.owl](nmdco-relation-graph.owl): A version of [nmdco.owl](nmdco.owl) that has been transformed into a [relation graph](https://github.com/balhoff/relation-graph). In [nmdco-relation-graph.owl](nmdco-relation-graph.owl), axioms containing quantifiers, such `some` or `only`, are transformed into simple `<subject> <predicate> <object>` assertions. For example, in the [Environment Ontology](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo), the axiom `'lake water' 'part of' some lake` is transformed into simply `'lake water' 'part of' lake`.  This makes the ontology easier to query.
- [nmdco.json](nmdco.json): A JSON version of [nmdco-relation-graph.owl](nmdco-relation-graph.owl).
- [nmdco-classes.json](nmdco-classes.json): A JSON version of [nmdco-relation-graph.owl](nmdco-relation-graph.owl) that contains only the classes and class hierarchy . For example, it does not contain `part of` relations between classes.

## Subsets

For convenience, we have a extracted a number of [subsets](subsets/) from the ontology. These subsets provide terms that can be used as values for the [Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS)](https://gensc.org/mixs) `env_broad_scale`, `env_local_scale`, or `env_medium` attributes.  
- [astronomical-body-parts-and-manufactured-products.tsv](subsets/astronomical-body-parts-and-manufactured-products.tsv)
- [astronomical-body-parts.tsv](subsets/astronomical-body-parts.tsv)
- [manufactured-products.tsv](subsets/manufactured-products.tsv)
- [non-terrestrial-biomes.tsv](subsets/non-terrestrial-biomes.tsv)
- [soil-environmental-materials.tsv](subsets/soil-environmental-materials.tsv)
- [terrestrial-biomes.tsv](subsets/terrestrial-biomes.tsv)
