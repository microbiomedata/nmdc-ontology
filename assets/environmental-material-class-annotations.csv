"" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.

The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.""

In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

ENVO_01000277,,"Water ice can appear transparent or opaque bluish-white color, depending on the presence of impurities or air inclusions. The addition of other materials such as soil may further alter its appearance.

When speaking about ice on Earth, usually water ice is meant - the solid, crystalline form of water found in the atmosphere as snow crystals, hail, ice pellets, etc., and on the earth's surface in forms such as hoarfrost, rime, glaze, sea ice, glacier ice, ground ice, frazil, anchor ice, etc.

This form of water is, strictly speaking, called ice Ih, the Roman numeral I distinguishing it from more than a dozen other phases and the letter h distinguishing it from the metastable cubic phase ice Ic. Ice Ih is the only one of the several known phases of water ice that is stable at commonly occurring temperatures and pressures. (Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.)

It has an open structure with a specific gravity of 0.9166 which is slightly less than water; because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0 C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly speaking the equilibrium point among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei.

In permafrost regions, ice may occupy voids in soils and rocks and may develop in a variety of forms. Ice may be colourless to pale blue or greenish-blue. It may appear white due to included gas bubbles; in exposures, ground ice may also appear black.

In nature ice is formed either by: (a) the freezing of water, (b) the condensation of atmospheric water vapour direct into ice crystals, (c) the compaction of snow with or without the motion of a glacier, or (d) the impregnation of porous snow masses with water which subsequently freeze.",Ice which is formed from water.,,,,,ice,,envoPolar,water ice,ENVO_01001125

Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). In brief, it forms first as lolly ice (frazil crystals), thickens into sludge, and coagulates into sheet ice, pancake ice, or into floes of various shapes and sizes. Thereafter, sea ice may develop into pack ice and/or become a form of pressure ice.  Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year ice and multi-year ice, where multiyear ice has survived at least two summers.",Water ice which has formed by the freezing of sea water.,Parse comment from GCW and new subclases where appropriate.,,,,,,envoPolar,sea ice,ENVO_01001557
