  comment:
  - '''In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material
    that lies above the ''solid geology''. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth"
    or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.''
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil


    " The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water,
    live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not
    considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep
    (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.


    The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult
    to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth''s surface that, in contrast
    to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate,
    relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary
    to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other
    marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary
    of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."  Soil taxonomy, 2nd Ed., quoted in http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280'

  comment:
  - In the United States, NOAA sea ice operations does not include superstructure
    icing as being sea ice. In sea ice operations however, sea ice is any form of
    ice found at sea which has originated from the freezing of sea water. It presents
    the main kind of floating ice encountered at sea. Except where it forms ridges,
    sea ice is up to a few metres thick, in which respect it differs from shelf ice.  Sea
    ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind
    and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast
    ice). In brief, it forms first as lolly ice (frazil crystals), thickens into sludge,
    and coagulates into sheet ice, pancake ice, or into floes of various shapes and
    sizes. Thereafter, sea ice may develop into pack ice and/or become a form of pressure
    ice.  Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is
    sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year
    ice and multi-year ice, where multiyear ice has survived at least two summers.

  comment:
  - 'Common liming agents include calcium- and magnesium-rich materials in various
    forms, including marl, chalk, limestone, burnt lime or hydrated lime. Liming often
    improves plant growth and increases the activity of soil bacteria, but oversupply
    may result in harm to plant life.

    Liming can also improve aggregate stability on clay soils. For this purpose structure
    lime, products containing calcium oxide (CaO) or hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in mixes
    with calcium carbonate (CaCO3), are often used. Structure liming can reduce losses
    of clay and nutrients from soil aggregates.'

  comment:
  - 'This definition is intentionally ambiguous to support the multiple thresholds
    set by different authorities. Some authorities consider this soil material that
    contains 80% or more silt and less than 12% clay. In the Udden-Wentworth scale
    (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than
    clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm
    and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike
    clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore,
    their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held
    together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction
    is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System
    (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is
    made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts

  - Ice which is formed from water.
  comment:
  - 'Water ice can appear transparent or opaque bluish-white color, depending on the
    presence of impurities or air inclusions. The addition of other materials such
    as soil may further alter its appearance.


    When speaking about ice on Earth, usually water ice is meant - the solid, crystalline
    form of water found in the atmosphere as snow crystals, hail, ice pellets, etc.,
    and on the earth''s surface in forms such as hoarfrost, rime, glaze, sea ice,
    glacier ice, ground ice, frazil, anchor ice, etc.


    This form of water is, strictly speaking, called ice Ih, the Roman numeral I distinguishing
    it from more than a dozen other phases and the letter h distinguishing it from
    the metastable cubic phase ice Ic. Ice Ih is the only one of the several known
    phases of water ice that is stable at commonly occurring temperatures and pressures.
    (Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being
    stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures
    up to about 100C.)


    It has an open structure with a specific gravity of 0.9166 which is slightly less
    than water; because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only
    in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken
    molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are
    crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers.
    The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in
    the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an
    air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0 C by definition of the Celsius
    temperature scale. (Strictly speaking the equilibrium point among water, ice,
    and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not
    invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency
    to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei.


    In permafrost regions, ice may occupy voids in soils and rocks and may develop
    in a variety of forms. Ice may be colourless to pale blue or greenish-blue. It
    may appear white due to included gas bubbles; in exposures, ground ice may also
    appear black.


    In nature ice is formed either by: (a) the freezing of water, (b) the condensation
    of atmospheric water vapour direct into ice crystals, (c) the compaction of snow
    with or without the motion of a glacier, or (d) the impregnation of porous snow
    masses with water which subsequently freeze.'

    amounts of silica, depending on the age of the deposit. The species of diatom
    may differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and
    paleo-environment of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined
    by its species. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth
    is 80 to 90% silica, with 2 to 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals)

  comment:
  - Typically 3 to 4 millimeters in diameter. These may form in both marine water
    and fresh water. They represent the first stages of sea ice growth; they merge
    under calm conditions to form thin sheets of ice on the surface (frazil ice),
    and consist of nearly pure fresh water. In fresh water, they form in supercooled
    water that is too turbulent to permit coagulation into sheet ice.  This is most
    common in swiftly flowing streams. They may accumulate as anchor ice on submerged
    objects obstructing the water flow.

  comment:
  - Depth hoar is associated with very fast crystal growth under large temperature
    gradients. Sometimes a layer of depth hoar forms just above, and may assist in
    identifying the summer surface. The low density and low strength of depth hoar
    can make it difficult to retrieve unbroken core sections during coring, and can
    complicate estimates of accumulation by microwave remote sensing. Layers of depth
    hoar also increase the likelihood of avalanching. This is one way in which firn
    formation may begin. Depth hoar is similar in physical origin to crevasse hoar.

  comment:
  - Rime is denser and harder than hoarfrost, but lighter, softer, and less transparent
    than glaze. Rime is composed essentially of discrete ice granules and has densities
    as low as 0.2-0.3 g cm-3. Glaze is generally continuous but with some air pockets
    and has much higher densities. Factors that favor rime formation are small drop
    size, slow accretion, a high degree of supercooling, and rapid dissipation of
    latent heat of fusion. The opposite effects favor glaze formation. Both rime and
    glaze occur when supercooled water drops strike an object at a temperature below
    freezing. Such formation on terrestrial objects constitutes an ice storm; on aircraft,
    it is called aircraft icing (where rime is known as rime ice). Either rime or
    glaze may form on snow crystals, droxtals, or other ice particles in the atmosphere.
    When such a deposit is wholly or chiefly of rime, snow pellets result; when most
    or all of the deposit is glaze, ordinary hail or ice pellets result. The alternating
    clear and opaque layers of some hailstones represent glaze and rime, deposited
    under varying conditions around the growing hailstone.

    to the condition that exists when the temperature of the Earth's surface and Earthbound
    objects fall below the melting point of water (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees
    Fahrenheit). Depending upon the actual values of ambient-air temperature, dewpoint,
    and the temperature attained by surface objects, frost may occur in a variety
    of forms. These include a general freeze, hoarfrost (or white frost), and dry
    freeze (or black frost). If a frost period is sufficiently severe to end the growing

  comment:
  - Sea ice develops from young ice; thickness from 0.3 to 2 meters (1 to 6.6 feet).  Sea
    ice be subdivided into thin first-year ice (white ice), medium first-year ice,
    and thick first-year ice.  First-year ice is distinguished from older ice primarily
    by having a higher salinity. Undeformed first-year ice differs from older ice
    in that it is smoother and lacks refrozen melt ponds. Characteristically level
    where undisturbed by pressure, but where ridges occur, they  distinguished by
    being larger, more angular, and more porous than multiyear ridges.

  - "The suspended particles may be partly ice crystals 20 to 100 micron in diameter,\
    \ but chiefly, especially when dense, droxtals 12-20 micron in diameter. Ice fog\
    \ is formed by direct freezing of supercooled water droplets with little growth\
    \ directly from the vapor. It occurs at very low temperatures, and usually in\
    \ clear, calm weather in high latitudes. The sun is usually visible and may cause\
    \ halo phenomena or luminous pillars. Ice fog is rare at temperatures warmer than\
    \ -30 \xB0C, and increases in frequency with decreasing temperature until it is\
    \ almost always present at air temperatures of -45 \xB0C in the vicinity of a\
    \ source of water vapor. Such sources are the open water of fast-flowing streams\
    \ or of the sea, herds of animals, volcanoes, and especially products of combustion\
    \ for heating or propulsion. At temperatures warmer than -30 \xB0C, these sources\
    \ can cause steam fog of liquid water droplets, which may turn into ice fog when\

  comment:
  - '"While fermentation is also referred to in the production of brewed teas, this
    is inaccurate. Some herbal teas on the market today include probiotic cultures
    alongside tea leaves to maintain gut health but the tea itself hasn''t been fermented.
    Most dried teas however don''t use live cultures at all during production. Instead,
    harvested tea leaves undergo a natural chemical process known as oxidation, which
    also changes the color, flavor and level of health benefits in the resulting brew."

  - 'Codex Alimentarius, Volume 2 - 1993, Section 2:  Pesticide Residues in Food.


    The Codex Classification of food and animal feed commodities moving in trade and
    the description of the various items and groups of food and animal feedstuffs
    included in the present document have been developed by the Codex Committee on
    Pesticide Residues. It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius
    Commission, (1989).


    The Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which
    Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification
    is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible,
    classified into groups on the basis of the commodity''s similar potential for
    pesticide residues.


    The Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting
    maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food.
    The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description
    of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum
    residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs.
    The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used
    to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the
    approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which
    a common group maximum residue limit can be set.'
