  - A biome is an ecosystem which is undergoing climactic ecological succession.
  comment:
  - In this definition, there is an assumption that no major perturbations are occurring
    or have occurred in a time frame affects the successional dynamics of the ecosystem.
    A "major" perturbation is one which disrupts the community's ability to restore
    its (near) equilibrium. Usually, pioneer or early secondary successional processes
    would be in effect in such scenarios.

  comment:
  - 'This class aligns to the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard
    (CMECS). In ENVO, we may adapt the definition for consistency, but the semantics
    (meaning) of the term should be unaffected. Please consult the CMECS catalogue
    (https://cmecscatalog.org/) for authoritative and semantically unconstrained definitions.
    CMECS provides the following notes: "Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along
    the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands
    or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized
    by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic
    Group. Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands
    along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers
    along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland
    along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also,
    mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs. The list of
    biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below,
    and the complete list is available in Appendix F"'

    by a few species of dwarf shrubs, a few grasses, sedges, lichens, and mosses -
    is stunted due to low temperatures and high winds.
  comment:
  - The absence of trees in this biome is primarily due to high altitude rather than
    high latitude. On Earth, it lies roughly between the summer isotherm of 10 degrees
    Centigrade and the snow line. Primary productivity is low in this biome because
    of the extremes of climate.
