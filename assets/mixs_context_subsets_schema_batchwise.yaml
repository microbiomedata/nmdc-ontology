    permissible_values:
      env_broad_scale:
        description: The major environmental system the sample or specimen came from.
          The system(s) identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide
          the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. in
          the desert or a rainforest). We recommend using subclasses of the EnvO biome
          class, ENVO_00000428.
        title: broad-scale environmental context
      env_local_scale:
        description: The entity or entities which are in the sample or specimen s
          local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences
          on your sample or specimen. We recommend using EnvO terms which are of smaller
          spatial grain than your entry for env_broad_scale. Terms, such as anatomical
          sites, from other OBO Library ontologies which interoperate with EnvO (e.g.
          UBERON) are accepted in this field
        title: local environmental context
      env_medium:
        description: The environmental material(s) immediately surrounding the sample
          or specimen at the time of sampling. We recommend using subclasses of 'environmental
          material', ENVO_00010483. Terms from other OBO ontologies are permissible
          as long as they reference mass/volume nouns (e.g. air, water, blood) and
          not discrete, countable entities (e.g. a tree, a leaf, a table top)
