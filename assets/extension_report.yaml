HostAssociated:
  comments: This is a very broad package, intended to capture many kinds of sequences
    derived from the bodies of or derived from an organism. Where possible, please
    use a more specific package. For example, consider using food-animal and animal
    feed extension for sampling of farm animals reared for consumption. For human
    stool microbiomes, consider MIxS-human-gut. Incidental associations of environmental
    material with an organism may also be better served by other packages. For example,
    nucleic acids derived from soil that was sampled from the hoof of a cow may be
    better described by terms from the soil extension; however, soil embedded in a
    wound on a cow's leg would be best described by terms in this extension
